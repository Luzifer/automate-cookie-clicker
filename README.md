This is a user-script for [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) playing [CookieClicker](http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) for you...

Should you use this? No. At least if you want to have fun with the game and are in a clicking competition with your colleagues. **They will call you "cheater" and they are right!**

So why did I write this? I've played CookieClicker several ascensions manually without assistance scripts and I slowly lost interest. Then I took it as a little challenge to write a user-script doing all the playing for me and here I am: Slowly improving this script and watching it to play for me... The challenge now is to automate everything...
